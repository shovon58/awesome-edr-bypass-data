üõ°Ô∏è Awesome EDR Bypass Resources For Ethical Hacking ‚öîÔ∏è

EDR bypass technology is not just for attackers.
Many malware now have EDR bypass capabilities, knowledge that pentesters and incident responders should also be aware of.
This repository is not intended to be used to escalate attacks. Use it for ethical hacking.

    - A technique called HellsGate, which specifies a system call number through a value in memory, combined with a technique to call a system call by specifying an address in NTDLL where the syscall instruction is implemented, without calling the syscall instruction.
