- [am0nsec/HellsGate: Original C Implementation of the Hell's Gate VX Technique](https://github.com/am0nsec/HellsGate)
    - The paper PDF has a nice summary of EDR Bypass techniques.
- [Maldev-Academy/HellHall: Performing Indirect Clean Syscalls](https://github.com/Maldev-Academy/HellHall)
    - A technique called HellsGate, which specifies a system call number through a value in memory, combined with a technique to call a system call by specifying an address in NTDLL where the syscall instruction is implemented, without calling the syscall instruction.
